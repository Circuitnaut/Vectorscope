# Vectorscope Inspiration

We'd been thinking of doing something analog this year, because we've been heavily digital with the [2019 FPGA badge](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/04/gigantic-fpga-in-a-game-boy-form-factor-2019-supercon-badge-is-a-hardware-siren-song/) and [last year's virtual retrocomputer](https://hackaday.com/2022/10/12/the-2022-supercon-badge-is-a-handheld-trip-through-computing-history/).  [Sebastian Holzapfel]'s [Eurorack FPGA frontend](https://hackaday.com/2023/02/13/an-open-hardware-eurorack-compatible-audio-fpga-front-end/) showed us how to abuse the AK4619 ADC/DAC chip for DC voltage purposes, and our path was clearer still.  

Finally, [Schneider] showed us the prototypes for the [flow3r badge for this summer's Chaos Camp](https://flow3r.garden/) in [Berlin](https://hackaday.com/2023/03/27/hackaday-berlin-was-bonkers/), and we needed to make a vintage round-screen scope.  Besides, we'd been looking for an excuse to try out those round screens since seeing [Scott Bezek]'s [SmartKnob](https://github.com/scottbez1/smartknob).  How could we resist?
